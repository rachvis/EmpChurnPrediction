# Employee Churn Prediction

## Overview of problem statement

Employee turn-over (also known as "employee churn") is a costly problem for companies. The true cost of replacing an employee can often be quite large. A study by the Center for American Progress found that companies typically pay about one-fifth of an employee’s salary to replace that employee, and the cost can significantly increase if executives or highest-paid employees are to be replaced.

In other words, the cost of replacing employees for most employers remains significant. This is due to the amount of time spent to interview and find a replacement, sign-on bonuses, and the loss of productivity for several months while the new employee gets accustomed to the new role.

## Dataset Analysis

In this case study, a HR dataset was sourced from IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance which contains employee data for 1,470 employees with various information about the employees. We will use this dataset to predict when employees are going to quit by understanding the main drivers of employee churn.

As stated on the IBM website "This is a fictional data set created by IBM data scientists".
Its main purpose was to demonstrate the IBM Watson Analytics tool for employee attrition.
